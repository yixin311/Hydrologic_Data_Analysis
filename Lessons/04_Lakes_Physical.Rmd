## Lesson Objectives
1. Investigate the relationships between temperature, light, and oxygen in lakes by analyzing monitoring data
2. Analyze changes in lake surface temperatures over time
3. Apply data analytics skills to questions about physical properties of lakes
4. Communicate findings with peers through oral, visual, and written modes


## Opening Discussion
We analyzed temperature profiles and seasonal changes on Wednesday. What were some key takeaway points about thermal stratification and mixing?

1.mixing in surface in bottom, thermal is defined by more than 1 degree change more than 1 meter, a chunk in thermal line.
2.surface area in apolimian, not always have hipolimian, cause it's shallow.
3. spring and fall mixing, lakes mix twice because of small density gradient and wind.
4. The 4 degree C, liquid water most dense at 4 *C

## Session Set Up
```{r, message = FALSE}
getwd()

library(tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)
library(cowplot)
library(lubridate)

NTLdata <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/NTL-LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw.csv")

theme_set(theme_classic())

```

## Data Wrangling and Exploration

### Investigate structure of dataset

```{r}
# Change sampledate to Date
NTLdata$sampledate <- as.Date(NTLdata$sampledate, "%m/%d/%y")

# Make three data frames, one for each lake
Pauldata <- filter(NTLdata, lakename == "Paul Lake")
Peterdata <- filter(NTLdata, lakename == "Peter Lake")
Tuesdaydata <- filter(NTLdata, lakename == "Tuesday Lake")

# Make a data frame to inspect 2016 data for Paul Lake
Pauldata.2016 <- filter(Pauldata, year4 == 2016)

```

### Data Visualization

Let's look at profiles of temperature, irradiance, and dissolved oxygen over the course of a season. We will use the `plot_grid` function from the cowplot package to put the graphs together on one plot. Pay attention to the differences among the formats of each plot and how these work together in the final plot. 

```{r}
Tempprofiles2016 <- 
  ggplot(Pauldata.2016, aes(x = temperature_C, y = depth, color = daynum)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  scale_x_continuous(position = "top") +
  scale_color_viridis_c(end = 0.8, option = "magma") +
  labs(x = expression("Temperature "(degree*C)), y = "Depth (m)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
print(Tempprofiles2016)

Lightprofiles2016 <- 
  ggplot(Pauldata.2016, aes(x = irradianceWater, y = depth, color = daynum)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  scale_x_continuous(position = "top") +
  scale_color_viridis_c(end = 0.8, option = "magma") + # end point (0,1)
  labs(x = expression("Irradiance (W m"^-2*")"), y = "Depth (m)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank())
print(Lightprofiles2016)

Oxygenprofiles2016 <- 
  ggplot(Pauldata.2016, aes(x = dissolvedOxygen, y = depth, color = daynum)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  scale_x_continuous(position = "top") +
  scale_color_viridis_c(end = 0.8, option = "magma") +
  labs(x = expression("DO (mg L"^-1*")"), y = "Depth (m)", 
       color = "Julian Day") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank())
print(Oxygenprofiles2016)

Physicalprofiles2016 <- 
  plot_grid(Tempprofiles2016, Lightprofiles2016, Oxygenprofiles2016, 
            ncol = 3, rel_widths = c(1.25, 1, 1.5)) # plot_grid 
# widths: 
print(Physicalprofiles2016)

```

How do temperature profiles vary over the course of a season? What are the mechanisms for this pattern?

> on the surface, the temperature range of is larger than it is in the bottom. temperature is increasing as it is closer to the surface.


How do irradiance profiles vary over the course of a season? What are the mechanisms for this pattern?

> 1. highest radiance in the surface and lowest in the bottom. water reflects light. 2. light penetration. 3.if there is biomass, light will go down deeper in the lake since algae still reflects light. 4. 

How do dissolved oxygen profiles vary over the course of a season? What are the mechanisms for this pattern?

> o2: chemical and biological active. From May to Aug, O2 decreases, water temperauture increases, o2 saturation decreases. 2. photosynthesis, enough light grow, nutrient, in 5 meters wrack. hipolimian ?.3. alage sinks down, nutrient release again; pytoplankon decreases below 5 m, no enough o2 supply, DO decreases. 


## Data Analysis

### Long-term change in temperature
How much have surface temperatures increased over the period of study? Is this increase significant? Isolate surface depths and run the test for May, June, July, and August temperatures separately. Use a linear regression with year as the predictor variable and temperature as the response variable.

Steps: 

1. Add a column named "Month" to the data frame (hint: lubridate package)
2. Filter your data frame so that it only contains surface depths and months 5-8
3. Create 4 separate data frames, one for each month
4. Run a linear regression for each data frame (see instructions above)
5. For significant trends, calculate how many degrees the lake has warmed over the period of study
5. Create a ggplot of surface temps by date and facet by month. Add `geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = lm)` to the plot to display the regression line.

```{r}
# add month column
new_column=Pauldata[,5]
Month=month(new_column)
Pauldata <- cbind(Pauldata,Month)

# Filter
Pauldata <- filter(Pauldata, depth == "0")
Pauldata.may <- filter(Pauldata, Month == 5)
Pauldata.june <- filter(Pauldata, Month == 6)
Pauldata.july <- filter(Pauldata, Month == 7)
Pauldata.aug <- filter(Pauldata, Month == 8)

#

Summarize your results below. How would you explain your findings and the importance of these findings to a non-specialist audience while still employing the data and statistical results?

## Closing Discussion
How do warming surface waters impact the physical properties of a lake? How might this affect the ecology of the lake?

How do we reconcile large amounts of variability in long-term records?
